# PyBer Challenge

## Background and purpose
V. Isualize has given me and Omar a brand-new assignment: using my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
 
## Results
Based on the multiple-line graph, the total weekly fare shows urban area has the highest amount among the three area, followed by suburban area then the rurual area. This rank is turn all the year round. Also the multiple-line graph shows little fluccuations exist for all three city types over the entire calendar year (ie. seaonal change is not very significant). 


## Summary: 
Suggestions to CEO: 
1. Allocate most of the investment to urban area, since it is the most profitable area;
2. Based on previous analysis, rural area has the highest averge fare among the three city types. However its total fare is the lowest. This means people in rural area use less Pyber (number of rides is low), but when they do, they tend to pay more money per trip. Analysis is suggested to figure out why less rides occurs in rural area.Is it becuase people don't know Pyber? or is it becuase peopel just travel less than people in suburban and urban area. once the reason is figured, further decision can be made depends on the results. 
3. Improving amounts of rides is more important to improve average fare per ride. Profits may be correlated to polulation desity of the area.
